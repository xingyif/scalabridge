Body:
Thanks for signing up for Intro to Programming with Scala - ScalaBridge Boston! The workshop is on this upcoming Sunday, August 5th, 2018. A big thank you to our sponsor - Hopper (275 Third Street · Cambridge, ma)!

This workshop is intended to reach out to anyone who is underrepresented in tech and interested in learning Scala.

**As we prepare lunch for the attendees according to the headcount, we kindly ask you to update your RSVP on meetup/ BridgeTroll if you can no longer attend.**

In this workshop, we'll take you through the basics of functional programming in Scala, a powerful programming language.

Install Bundle
At the beginning of the workshop, we will install https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-scala-bundle for setting up the dev env. It is strongly recommended that you try to install this bundle before the workshop. During the workshop, any problems related to the bundle can be asked in this gitter channel: https://gitter.im/scalabridgeboston/intellijbundle

Tutorial
We will be using Creative Scala tutorial for learning scala. It is not required to go through the tutorial before the workshop.
