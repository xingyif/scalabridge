# :alarm_clock: Event Reminders

**Optimal start time of this step: 1 month before the workshop**


## :hourglass_flowing_sand: Why send out reminders?
One of the best ways to ensure that you have a reasonable turn out for the workshop is to remind students and mentors about the event consecutively. Keep in mind that the usual turn out for the workshop is 50% of the people who registered for your event. You should also be prepared for people who did not register to show up.


## :telephone_receiver: Who to remind?
1. :school_satchel: Students
2. :school: Mentors

Reminder emails should be sent out separately for the two different groups.


## :clock2: One Month Before the event:
