# :alarm_clock: Event Reminders

**Optimal start time of this step: 1 month before the workshop**


## :hourglass_flowing_sand: Why send out reminders?
One of the best ways to ensure that you have a reasonable turnout for the workshop is to remind students and mentors about the event repeatedly. Keep in mind that the usual turnout for the workshop is 50% of the people who registered. (Some people who did not register may also show up.)


## :telephone_receiver: Who to remind?
1. :school_satchel: Students
2. :school: Mentors

Reminder emails should be sent out separately for the two different groups.


## :clock2: One Month Before the event:
You would want to remind people of the workshop to ensure that they can still attend, or, to remind them to update their RSVP if they can no longer attend.

## :clock230: Two weeks before the event:
In addition to reminding people of the event, you should finalize the number of people who signed up for the event. :bangbang: Give the final head count to the sponsor so they can be ready with space and food.
You will also want to give a heads up to your mentors about what to expect on the workshop day.
