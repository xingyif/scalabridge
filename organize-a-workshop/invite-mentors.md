# Invite Mentors for the Workshop
Mentors are the most important part of the workshop. It can be a little challenging if you're relatively new to the community and new to organizing ScalaBridge events. But don't worry. This page will make it easier for you, hopefully! :)


## General Process
There are two parts of inviting mentors.
The first round is that before you pick a date for the event, you should personally reach out to a few people who are interested in helping out with the event by being a mentor.

The second round is after you've picked an event date. You can promote the event while inviting/ attracting more mentors.


## Who should you invite?
- People who knows how to code in Scala.
- People who are interested in teaching beginners Scala.
- People who are involved in the Scala community (Doesn't have to be famous Scala people).
- People who are nice and patient.


## How do you personally reach out to mentors?
For people who already know many other Scala developers, feel free to directly reach out to them.

For people who are relatively new to the community and who are new to organizing bridge events, here are [a list of mentors](#interested--mentors), who are interested in mentoring.

## How do you get more mentors to sign up?
There are a few ways to promote your event:
- Twitter
- BridgeTroll
- Local Meetup


## Next Step:
- We will discuss how to promote the workshop [here](./promote-workshop.md).

- Go back to the [table of content](../README.md).
