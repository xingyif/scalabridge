# :notes: Post Workshop

Congratulations for finishing organizing a ScalaBridge workshop! Thank you for your hard work! :heart:


## :ferris_wheel: What to do next?
1. Send out a "thank you" email to those who attended. Here is an [example email](../sample-emails/post-workshop-thank-you.md).

   :envelope: Email should include:
    - Thanks to the mentors and students
    - [Resources](https://scalabridge.gitbooks.io/curriculum/content/resources.html) to learn more about Scala
    - (Optional) Post-workshop survey (to learn about how to improve).


## :couple: :two_women_holding_hands: :two_men_holding_hands: Here are a few things you can do to help grow our community:

1. :cyclone: Chat Platform
   
   One of the goals of ScalaBridge is to increase diversity in the Scala community. It is a good idea to create a platform that allows people to ask questions and to keep in touch. Gitter is one of the good options. Please visit [Gitter ScalaBridgeLobby](https://gitter.im/scalabridgeboston/Lobby) for an example.

2. :open_hands: Collaborate with Scala meetups

   Organize events with local Scala meetups to bring ScalaBridge attendees into the community by inviting them to local meetups. Many Scala beginners are intimidated to attend meetups because the talks might be too advanced or they do not feel eligible to call themselves "Scala users". Although the workshop ended, the mission continues. It is our goal to make everyone, beginners and non-beginners, to feel inclusive.
   
   Some of the co-events ideas:
   - Beginner-friendly talks at meetups
   - Scala Mentors/ Mentees Program
   - Scala Buddies: pair people, who are interested in learning Scala, up
