# Promote Workshop

The goal of promoting the workshop is to:
1. Invite students who are underrepresented in tech
2. Invite more mentors


## Create Event

1. Meetup

⋅⋅⋅Advantage: broad variety of audiences


2. BridgeTroll

⋅⋅⋅Advantage: BridgeTroll will send out a notification to everyone who has participated in any bridge events before. You will be able to reach out to people who are interested/ familiar with bridge events.
⋅⋅⋅It has really good organization tools for you to collect student info and to send notification emails.

⋅⋅⋅Disadvantage: challenging to reach out to people who are not aware of/ has never participated in any bridge events.


3. Eventbrite

⋅⋅⋅Advantage: good organization tool


## What tools/platforms should you use to promote?
Know your audiences is the first step. Then promote on the platform where they are active.
ScalaBridge workshop's audiences are:
1. people who are not already in the community (students)
2. people who are in the community (mentors)


## How to promote to students?
1. Meetup groups

⋅⋅⋅Local meetup groups are great platforms for spreading the words. You can post the event registration link to the meetup group discussion. It is even better if you can send a notification email to everyone on the email list.

2. Email lists of different groups

⋅⋅⋅This is a very effective way of direct promotion of the event.


3. Social Media

⋅⋅⋅Including but not limited to: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.
