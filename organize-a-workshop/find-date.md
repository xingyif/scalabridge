# Find An Event Date for the Workshop

The first step of organizing a ScalaBridge workshop is to find an optimal date for the workshop. If you are at this stage, then you're at the beginning of planning a workshop. It is recommended to find a date that is in 3 months, so that you have enough time to [find sponsorship](#sponsorship.md), [find mentors](#invite-mentors.md), and [promote the event](#promote.md).

## How to find a date?

#### Standalone Workshop
If you're organizing a **standalone** ScalaBridge workshop (instead of with a conference), it is better to propose a few dates on the weekends so that most people are available to attend.

From my past experience of organizing ScalaBridge workshops, I usually personally reach out to a few interested mentors first to find out their availabilities. I've used [Doodle](https://doodle.com/) for collecting mentors' availabilities. The date which most of the mentors are available will be selected as the workshop date.

For example, if I am currently organizing a workshop in May, I will propose a few dates on the weekends in August or September for the mentors to choose.


#### Conference Workshop
If you're organizing a workshop with a **conference**, most of the workshops are organized on the day before the conference.
