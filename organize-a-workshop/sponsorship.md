# Find Sponsorship

**Optimal start time of this step: 3 months before the workshop**


The goal of sponsorship of a ScalaBridge workshop is to be able to provide food and space on the day of the event.

## How to find a sponsor/ company?

Many companies are very willing to help out with such an event. Please do not hesitate to reach out. There are a few ways of reaching out:

1. Your Wonderful Employer
   
   The "closest" and maybe the easiest one to ask if your employer. Talk with your coworkers and the designated event organizer to see if they are willing to provide food and space.
   
    
2. Local Meetup Email List
   
   Send out an email to meetup groups is also another good way to reach out to companies. Many of them will responde.
   
3. Twitter
   
   Post that you're looking for sponsorships on Twitter, ping me ([@yifan_xing_e](https://twitter.com/yifan_xing_e)). I and many others will be happy to retweet.
   

## What to do when you find a sponsor?

**It is important to communicate and share your expectations with the company before moving on to the next steps.**

1. The first step is to make sure that the sponsor/ company understands they role at the event. As a sponsor, they will provide food and space for the workshop day. You can then discuss with the company about the details, including what types of food, how much to prepare, when do you have the space until, etc.

2. Share the event date with the company to make sure that they understand when to host.

3. Share the expected size of the crowd.

4. Take an onsite tour to the company if you can. Be familiar with the space. Make plans for:
    - Making sure it is big enough to host for the size of the crowd that you're hoping for
    - Making sure it has enough tables/ chairs
    - Making sure it has enough space for people to form into groups.
